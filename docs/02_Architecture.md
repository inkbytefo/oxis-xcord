# XCord Architecture

## System Architecture Overview

XCord implements a microservices architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and reliability. Each service is independently deployable and scalable, communicating through well-defined APIs.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Service Independence
- Each microservice is autonomous
- Independent deployment and scaling
- Service-specific data storage
- Loose coupling between services

### 2. Communication Patterns

#### Synchronous Communication
- REST APIs for request-response patterns
- gRPC for service-to-service communication
- WebSocket for real-time features

#### Asynchronous Communication
- Message queues for event-driven architecture
- Event sourcing for state management
- Pub/Sub patterns for real-time updates

### 3. Data Management
- Database per service pattern
- Event-driven data consistency
- CQRS pattern for complex queries
- Data replication strategies

## Service Architecture

### 1. API Gateway

#### Responsibilities
- Request routing and load balancing
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Request/response transformation
- API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)

#### Technologies
- Node.js with Express
- Redis for rate limiting
- JWT for authentication

### 2. Auth Service

#### Responsibilities
- User authentication
- Authorization management
- Token management
- User profile management

#### Data Model
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  username: string;
  email: string;
  password: string;
  roles: string[];
  profile: UserProfile;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

interface UserProfile {
  avatar: string;
  status: string;
  customStatus: string;
  settings: UserSettings;
}
```

### 3. Messaging Service

#### Responsibilities
- Message handling and storage
- Real-time message delivery
- Channel management
- Message history and search

#### Data Model
```typescript
interface Message {
  id: string;
  channelId: string;
  authorId: string;
  content: string;
  attachments: Attachment[];
  mentions: string[];
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

interface Channel {
  id: string;
  serverId: string;
  name: string;
  type: ChannelType;
  permissions: Permission[];
}
```

### 4. Voice Service

#### Responsibilities
- Voice channel management
- Real-time audio streaming
- Voice server allocation
- Quality of service monitoring

#### Technologies
- WebRTC for peer connections
- Redis for session management
- Prometheus for metrics

### 5. Server Management Service

#### Responsibilities
- Server creation and management
- Role and permission management
- Server settings and configuration
- Member management

#### Data Model
```typescript
interface Server {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  ownerId: string;
  channels: Channel[];
  roles: Role[];
  members: Member[];
  settings: ServerSettings;
}

interface Role {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  permissions: Permission[];
  color: string;
  position: number;
}
```

## Security Architecture

### 1. Authentication
- JWT-based authentication
- OAuth2.0 integration
- Refresh token rotation
- Session management

### 2. Authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Permission hierarchy
- Resource-level permissions
- API endpoint protection

### 3. Data Security
- End-to-end encryption for messages
- Data encryption at rest
- Secure password hashing
- Regular security audits

## Scalability and Performance

### 1. Horizontal Scaling
- Container orchestration with Kubernetes
- Auto-scaling based on metrics
- Load balancing strategies
- Database sharding

### 2. Caching Strategy
- Multi-level caching
- Redis for distributed caching
- Cache invalidation patterns
- Cache-aside pattern

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Connection pooling
- Query optimization
- CDN integration
- Resource compression

## Monitoring and Observability

### 1. Metrics Collection
- Prometheus for metrics
- Grafana for visualization
- Custom business metrics
- SLA monitoring

### 2. Logging
- Centralized logging with ELK Stack
- Structured log format
- Log level management
- Log retention policies

### 3. Tracing
- Distributed tracing with Jaeger
- Request correlation
- Performance bottleneck analysis
- Error tracking

## Disaster Recovery

### 1. Backup Strategy
- Regular automated backups
- Cross-region replication
- Point-in-time recovery
- Backup verification

### 2. High Availability
- Multi-zone deployment
- Failover mechanisms
- Circuit breakers
- Health checks

## Development and Deployment

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline
- Automated testing
- Container image building
- Deployment automation
- Environment promotion

### 2. Environment Management
- Development environment
- Staging environment
- Production environment
- Feature flags

## Future Considerations

### 1. Scalability Improvements
- Global distribution
- Edge computing integration
- Advanced caching strategies
- Performance optimization

### 2. Feature Enhancements
- Video streaming capabilities
- File sharing improvements
- Enhanced search functionality
- AI/ML integration
